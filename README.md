## Hello world! 👋


My name is Szymon. I'm currently working on backend, but doing my best to become a real Devops G.

##### BIO

- 🏢 I'm currently working at **[Axabee (Itaka)](https://axabee.com/)**
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.cs`, `.sql`, `.ts`, `.css`, `.html` but it's not a problem to switch to languages like `.py`, `.php` or various Devops tools
- 🌍 My favorite programming language is **CSharp**
- 📝 Best IDEs? Everything from **Jetbrains**
- 💻 **MacOS** is my favorite operating system, but i used to work on **Windows 11** and **Linux** distribution too

<br>

I may be not active on Github, but remember, I work with Gitlab on daily basis! :smiley_cat:
