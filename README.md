## Hello world! 👋

I'm looking for a job right now. If you need a fast-learning and proactive .NET developer, contact me via DM!

My name is Szymon. I'm currently working on backend, but doing my best to become a real Devops G.

##### BIO

- 🏢 I'm currently working at **[TP24]([https://rentalsunited.com/](https://tp24group.com/ch/en))**
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.cs`, `.sql`, `.ts`, `.css`, `.html` but it's not a problem to switch to languages like `.rs`, `.php` or various Devops tools
- 🌍 My favorite programming language is **CSharp**
- 📝 Best IDEs? Everything from **Jetbrains** and **Visual Studio Code**
- 💻 **MacOS** is my favorite operating system, but i used to work on **Windows 11** and **Linux** distribution too

I may be not active on Github, but remember, I work with Bitbucket on daily basis! :smiley_cat:
